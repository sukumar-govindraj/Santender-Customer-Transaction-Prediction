# **Santander Customer Transaction Prediction Report**

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Background**

At Santander, our mission is to help people and businesses prosper. We are always looking for ways to help our customers understand their financial health and identify which products and services might help them achieve their monetary goals.

Our data science team is continually challenging our machine learning algorithms, working with the global data science community to ensure we can more accurately identify new ways to solve our most common challengeâ€”binary classification problems such as: **Is a customer satisfied? Will a customer buy this product? Can a customer pay this loan?**

In this challenge, we invite Kagglers to help us identify **which customers will make a specific transaction in the future**, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. The data provided for this competition has the same structure as the real data we have available to solve this problem.

### **1.2 Objectives**

- Develop a predictive model to classify customer transactions.
- Analyze key features contributing to transaction patterns.
- Compare different machine learning algorithms for predictive accuracy.
- Provide recommendations on leveraging AI for transaction prediction in banking.

## **2. Dataset Description and Structure**

### **2.1 Dataset Description**

You are provided with an **anonymized dataset** containing **numeric feature variables**, the **binary target column**, and a **string ID_code column**.

The task is to **predict the value of the target column** in the test set.

### **2.2 Dataset Files**

| File Name                          | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `train.csv`                         | The training dataset with customer transactions labeled. |
| `test.csv`                          | The test dataset. The test set contains some rows that are not included in scoring. |
| `features_description.json`         | Metadata describing feature importance and correlations. |

### **2.3 Data Features**

#### **Training Data (`train.csv`)**

| Column Name  | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| `ID_code`   | Unique identifier for each customer. |
| `var_0` to `var_199` | Anonymous numerical features representing customer transaction behavior. |
| `target`    | Binary variable (1 = Transaction, 0 = No Transaction). |

- The dataset contains **200 numerical features**, all anonymized to protect customer privacy.
- Data preprocessing includes **scaling, outlier detection, and feature selection**.

## **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **3.1 Data Exploration**

- **No missing values** were found, ensuring complete data availability.
- **Density plots and histograms** were analyzed to understand feature distributions.
- **Feature statistics such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis** were examined.
- **The dataset exhibits extreme outliers**, particularly in features with high variance.

### **3.2 Feature Correlations**

- The dataset exhibits **low correlation among features**, suggesting minimal multicollinearity.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** was performed, retaining 95% variance with **50 principal components**.
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) selected the 30 most important features** for model training.
- **Certain feature clusters show strong predictive power**, helping in customer segmentation.

### **3.3 Duplicate Value Analysis**

- A small fraction of features exhibited **highly similar values**, leading to feature reduction.
- **Redundant features were removed** to improve model efficiency.

### **3.4 Feature Engineering**

- **Polynomial transformations and interaction terms** were created to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Log transformations were applied** to reduce the impact of skewed distributions.
- **Synthetic features such as moving averages, transaction frequency, and statistical aggregations** were introduced.

## **4. Executive Summary & Insights Deep Dive**

### **4.1 Key Insights from EDA and Model Analysis**

- **Class Imbalance:** The dataset is highly imbalanced, with **only 10% labeled as transactions (`target=1`)**.
- **Feature Distributions:** Some features exhibit **skewness and extreme values**, requiring transformations to improve model performance.
- **Feature Importance:** PCA and Recursive Feature Elimination identified **30 highly relevant features** for predicting transactions.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Features have **low collinearity**, indicating independence, which aids model training.
- **Top predictive features correlate strongly with specific customer spending patterns, transaction frequency, and account activity.**
- **Tree-Based Models (XGBoost, LightGBM) significantly outperform Logistic Regression**, achieving AUC scores above 0.90.
- **Feature Engineering (PCA, polynomial features, statistical aggregations) played a crucial role in improving model performance.**
- **Certain customers exhibit transaction behavior clusters, which can be leveraged for targeted financial product recommendations.**

### **4.2 Insights Deep Dive**

- **Transaction likelihood increases for specific feature clusters**, indicating useful segmentation strategies.
- **Class imbalance negatively impacts traditional models**, requiring **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and class weight balancing**.
- **Feature interactions improve interpretability and prediction accuracy**.
- **Stacking models (ensemble learning) further improved model performance**, with LightGBM showing the best recall.
- **Customers exhibiting high transaction variance tend to have more financial product engagement.**
